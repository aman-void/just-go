# 01 — Setting Up Your Go Environment

Original notes on the toolchain and module basics.

## What I ran

- `go mod init github.com/aman-void/just-go/01-hello-go` — one module per chapter.
- `go run .` — overview; `go run ./greet Ada` and `go run ./toolchain` for subexamples.
- `make vet / fmt / build` — same as `go vet ./...`, `gofmt -l .`, `go build ./...`.

## Notes

- A module is just a directory with a `go.mod` naming it; the toolchain uses
  that path for imports. No build config beyond that for a small program.
- `go run` compiles to a temp dir (nothing saved); `go build` leaves a binary.
- `gofmt` is the style authority — run it instead of debating formatting.
- `go vet` catches real mistakes (bad format verbs, unreachable code) that
  compile fine, so run it before assuming code is correct.
- The compat promise means code written today should still build on newer Go;
  upgrade the toolchain freely, pin the `go` line in `go.mod` per module.
- Editor choice doesn't matter much: any editor + terminal with the commands
  above is enough; the playground is handy for sharing snippets.
