# 05 — Functions

The big idea: functions are Go's only unit of behavior, and in this chapter they
wear every hat at once — several return values, named results, a stand-in for
optional parameters, and first-class values that can be passed around and that
remember things (closures). `defer` is the cleanup hook riding along the whole
time. Picture the chapter as the pit wall of a race team: every helper has a job,
hands back a report, and cleans up its station before the next stint.

## How to run

- `go build ./...` type-checks all five subexamples at once.
- `go run .` is only an orientation; every topic is its own program.
- Or use the chapter Makefile: `make run <topic>` (e.g. `make run multiple-returns`); `make list` lists the topics and `make check` runs the gate.
- Suggested order for the first pass:

| Order | Run it | What it teaches you |
| ----- | ------ | ------------------- |
| 1 | `go run ./multiple-returns` | Returning `(value, ok)` instead of throwing |
| 2 | `go run ./named-return-shadowing` | Named results, blank `return`, and `:=` shadows |
| 3 | `go run ./options-variadic` | No named/optional params: struct options + `...T` |
| 4 | `go run ./anonymous-closure-func` | Functions as values; closures keep state |
| 5 | `go run ./defer-func` | `defer` cleanup, last-in-first-out |

## 1. Multiple returns: an answer plus a receipt (`multiple-returns/`)

Plain English: a Go function can hand back more than one value, and the language
leans on that for `(value, ok)` and `(value, error)`. The function returns the
answer *and* a note about whether the answer is real, instead of throwing an
exception.

Real world: the lost-and-found desk. You ask for a driver's badge by ID and get
the badge *plus* a slip saying whether it was on file. `lookupUser("001")` comes
back as Alice's record and `true`; an unknown ID comes back as an empty record
and `false` — no explosion, just a slip that reads "not found".

```go
func lookupUser(id string) (user, bool) {
	user, found := users[id]
	return user, found
}
```

`main` checks the receipt before using the badge:

```go
u, ok := lookupUser("001")
if !ok {
	fmt.Println("Not found")
} else {
	fmt.Printf("%s <%s>\n", u.Name, u.Email)
}
```

Output:

```text
Alice <alice@example.com>
```

Beginner trap: a failed lookup still returns a **zero-valued** `user` (empty
name, empty email). Ignore `ok` and print `u.Name` anyway and you get a blank
that looks like data, with no error to warn you. Always look at the second
value — it is the entire reason the return exists.

## 2. Named returns: labeled crates (`named-return-shadowing/`)

Plain English: you may name a function's results in its signature. The names
become zero-valued variables that live in the body, and a bare `return` ships
whatever they currently hold. It buys readability on long signatures and cheap
error setup — at the price of hidden control flow.

Real world: instead of tossing loose parts at the loading dock
(`return num/denom, num%denom, nil`), you keep labeled crates — `result`,
`remainder`, `err` — by the door and just wave "ship it" when ready.

```go
func divide(num, denom int) (result int, err error) {
	if denom == 0 {
		return 0, errors.New("division by zero")
	}
	result = num / denom
	return // ships the current values of result and err
}
```

Output:

```text
divide(10, 2)                -> 5 <nil>
```

Beginner trap: one character flips it. Writing `result := num / denom` inside an
`if` (with `:=`) declares a **new** `result` scoped to that block, so the named
one is never assigned and the bare `return` hands back 0. The program's
`divideShadowed` does exactly that — it prints the right answer on its way out,
then returns nothing:

```text
     shadowed result = 5
divideShadowed(10, 2)        -> 0 <nil>
```

Assign to the named result with `=`, and prefer writing the values out
(`return result, nil`) over a blank `return` that forces the reader to scan
upward.

## 3. No optional params: a form and a bottomless basket (`options-variadic/`)

Plain English: Go has no named or optional parameters and no overloads. You get
two substitutes: pass a **struct** whose unfilled fields default to zero values
(that is your "optional"), or declare a **variadic** parameter `...T` to accept
any number of same-typed arguments.

Real world: ordering at a counter. The struct is the paper form — write your
name, skip age and it just reads back 0. The variadic is the bottomless basket:
`addNumbers("addNumbers", 1, 2, 3, ...)` keeps taking numbers until you stop.

```go
type greetOptions struct {
	Name    string
	Age     int
	Address string
}

func greetUser(opts greetOptions) {
	fmt.Printf("Hello %s, I know your age is %d\n", opts.Name, opts.Age)
}
```

```go
func addNumbers(label string, nums ...int) (string, int) {
	total := 0
	for _, num := range nums {
		total += num
	}
	return label, total
}
```

Output:

```text
Hello Mohammad, I know your age is 12
addNumbers 39
addNumbers2:  108
```

Beginner trap: inside the function a variadic parameter is just a `[]int` — a
nil slice when you pass none, which `range` handles fine — it *must* be the last
parameter, and at the call site you expand an existing slice with `nums...`
rather than passing it bare. That same `...` rule shows up as
`append(dst, src...)`.

## 4. Functions as values: reusable machines with a memory (`anonymous-closure-func/`)

Plain English: a function is a value like an `int`. You can store it in a
variable, pass it to another function, or return it from one. A **closure** is a
function value that remembers the variables around the place it was written —
including the ones that let it keep state between calls.

Real world: `makeAdder(10)` hands back a machine with its dial set to "+10", so
you never pass 10 again. `newCounter()` hands back a tally clicker that remembers
how many times you pressed it.

```go
func makeAdder(alwaysAdd int) func(int) int {
	return func(n int) int { return n + alwaysAdd }
}

func newCounter() func() int {
	count := 0
	return func() int { count++; return count }
}
```

Output:

```text
double(5)             -> 10
addTen(5)             -> 15
addTen(100)           -> 110
count() three times   -> 1 2 3
other()               -> 1
```

Beginner trap: a closure captures the **variable**, not a snapshot of its value.
Before Go 1.22, a closure built in a `for` loop saw the single reused loop
variable, so a slice of adders all added the *last* number. Each iteration now
gets its own copy (driven by the `go` line in `go.mod`), which is why the
program prints `2 + 100 -> 102`, `3 + 100 -> 103`, `4 + 100 -> 104`. Second trap:
function values compare only against `nil` — `f == g` will not compile — so use
`== nil` as the "is this actually set?" guard before calling.

## 5. `defer`: the cleanup that always runs (`defer-func/`)

Plain English: `defer` schedules a call to run when the surrounding function
returns — no matter how it returns, normal or early or panicking. Stack several
and they run last-in-first-out, like trays at a dish station.

Real world: opening a file, you book the cleanup the moment the resource exists;
if any later step fails, the close still happens. The classic shape:

```go
func fileLen(fileName string) (int, error) {
	f, err := os.Open(fileName)
	if err != nil {
		return 0, err
	}
	defer f.Close() // runs when fileLen returns

	info, err := f.Stat()
	if err != nil {
		return 0, err
	}
	return int(info.Size()), nil
}
```

Run against the fixture in this folder, `./defer-func/hello.txt`, it reports the size:

```text
size of ./defer-func/hello.txt is: 19 bytes
```

Stacking five defers shows the order — last deferred, first run:

```go
func runDefer() {
	defer fmt.Println("defer func 1")
	defer fmt.Println("defer func 2")
	// ... f3, f4, f5
}
```

Output:

```text
defer func 5
defer func 4
defer func 3
defer func 2
defer func 1
```

Beginner trap: deferred calls run last-in-first-out, and their **arguments are
evaluated at the `defer` line**, not when they finally run — `defer
fmt.Println(i)` in a loop prints the value `i` held at that moment. Also remember
`defer` is function-scoped, not block-scoped: a `defer` inside a loop keeps every
file open until the whole function returns, so hoist the loop body into its own
function when that matters.

## Rules I want to remember

- Return `(value, ok)` / `(value, error)` instead of throwing; check the second
  value, because zero values masquerade as real data.
- Named results are zero-valued locals; a bare `return` ships their current
  values. Assign with `=`, never shadow them with `:=`.
- No named/optional parameters: use struct options (unset fields = zero value)
  or a variadic `...T` (last param, becomes a slice). Expand a slice with
  `slice...`.
- Functions are values: assign them, pass them, return them, store them in
  slices.
- Closures capture variables, not snapshots, and keep them alive between calls.
  Since Go 1.22 each loop iteration has its own variable.
- Func values compare only to `nil`.
- `defer` runs at function return (LIFO, on panic too) and its args are evaluated
  at the `defer` line — it is *the* cleanup hook.
